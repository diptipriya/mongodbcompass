MongoDB
To be able to experiment with the code examples, you will need access to a MongoDB database.

You can download a free MongoDB database at https://www.mongodb.com.

Or get started right away with a MongoDB cloud service at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.

Install MongoDB Driver
Let us try to access a MongoDB database with Node.js.

To download and install the official MongoDB driver, open the Command Terminal and execute the following:

Download and install mongodb package:

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install mongodb
Now you have downloaded and installed a mongodb database driver.

Node.js can use this module to manipulate MongoDB databases:

var mongo = require('mongodb');
